perms — sets access permissions on tags and namespaces
******************************************************

The ``perms`` command provides a simple interface for changing the
permissions on tags and namespaces.   It only supports five cases,
but there are powerful enough to cover the vast bulk of common
situations.

**FORM**
::

    fish [flags] perms permissions-spec list-of-one-or-more-tags-or-namespaces

Here ``permissions-spec`` can be one of the short forms:

  * ``private``
  * ``default``
  * ``lock``
  * ``unlock``
  * ``group list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses``
  * ``group-write list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses``
  * ``group-read list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses``

or one of three low-level forms:

  * ``read [open|closed] [except list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses]``
  * ``write [open|closed] [except list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses]``
  * ``control [open|closed] [except list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses]``

**FLAGS**

  ``-f``  The ``-f`` flag is used to force ``fish`` to set a policy it
          would otherwise resist.  In particular, setting any policy that
          does not include owner control always requires use of the ``-f``
          flag.

  ``-X name -X name2`` The ``-X`` flag is used two allow fully
                       fine-grained control over permissions.
                       If one or more ``-X`` flags are used.
                       only the finest-grained permissions with
                       the fish names specified are changed.
                       These are the names shown by ls -L:

                         - ``metadata``, ``delete``, ``acontrol`` for abstract
			   tags                          
                         - ``read``, ``tag``, ``untag``, ``tcontrol`` for tags
                         - ``read``, ``create``, ``delete``, ``control``
                           for namespaces.

                       For example:
                       ::

                          fish perms write -X delete closed except alice /fish/z

                       Changes the fine-grained write permission
		       ``delete`` on ``fish/z`` so that only ``alice`` has
		       the permission.

                       ``-X`` is rarely used.

**EXAMPLES**

The eight special cases supported are as follows and apply equally
namespaces and tags.  In what follows, we'll use a ``rating`` tag and
a namespace called ``friends``.

  * Make a tag or namespace completely private.
    ::

        $ fish perms private rating
        $ fish perms private fi

    We could also change them together by saying:
    ::

        $ fish perms private rating fi

    This sets the permissions so that only the owner of the tag
    or namespace has permission to do anything with it---``read``, ``write``
    and ``control`` permission.
    The abbreviated view of this is shown by
    ::

        $ fish ls -ld rating fi
        trwc------   alice/rating
        nrwc------   alice/fi/

    (See :ref:`fishls` for an detailed explanation of the permissions codes.)

    The full listing after this is:
    ::

        $ fish -F ls -Ld rating fi

        alice/rating:

        TAG (/tags)
          Write
            update (metadata):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
            delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]

        TAG (/tag-values)
          Read
            read (read):        policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
          Write
            create (tag):       policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
            delete (untag):     policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]


        alice/fi/:

        NAMESPACE (/namespaces)
          Read
            list (read):        policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
          Write
            create (create):    policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
            delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]

  * Restore default permissions to a tag or namespace.
    The default is that the owner has read, write and control
    and everyone else has read only:
    ::

        $ fish perms default rating fi

        $ fish -F ls -ld rating fi
        trwcr--r--   alice/rating
        nrwcr--r--   alice/fi/

  * Lock a namespace or tag so that it can't be edited (i.e.,
    remove all write permissions).
    ::

      $ fish perms lock rating

      $ fish ls -l alice/rating
      tr-cr--r--   alice/rating

    This does not alter read or control permissions.

  * Unlock a namespace or tag so that the owner (only) can edit it.
    ::

      $ fish perms unlock rating

      $ fish ls -l alice/rating
      trwcr--r--   alice/rating

    This does not alter read or control permissions.

  * Set the permissions on a tag or namespace so that one or more extra people
    can write it.   (This does not alter read permissions.)
    ::

        $ fish perms group-write bert+jacqui rating fi

        $ fish ls -gd rating fi
        trwcrw-r--   r:(world)  w:bert+jacqui   alice/rating
        nrwcrw-r--   r:(world)  w:bert+jacqui   alice/fi/

  * Set the permissions so that only a particular group can read it,
    leaving write permissions as the are.
    ::

        $ fish perms default rating fi
        $ fish perms group-read bert+jacqui+miro rating fi

        $ fish -F ls -gd rating fi
        trwcr-----   r:bert+jacqui+miro  w:(world)   alice/rating
        nrwcr-----   r:bert+jacqui+miro  w:(world)   alice/fi/

  * Set permissions so that one group of users can write tge tag
    or namespace, and another group can read it.
    In this case, let's allow ``miro`` to write and ``bert`` and
    ``jacqui`` (as well as ``miro``) to read.
    ::

        $ fish perms group-read bert+jacqui+miro rating fi
        $ fish perms group-write miro rating fi

        $ fish ls -gd rating fi
        trwcrw----   r:bert+jacqui+miro  w:miro   alice/rating
        nrwcrw----   r:bert+jacqui+miro  w:miro   alice/fi/

  * The final case is really just a special case of the previous one,
    where the read and write groups are the same.
    Let's make ``miro`` the only user (other the owner, ``alice``)
    who can read or write the tag and namespace.
    ::

        $ fish perms group miro rating fi

        $ fish ls -gd rating fi
        trwcrw----   miro   alice/rating
        nrwcrw----   miro   alice/fi/

The three low-level case are exemplified by the following.
In these forms, the Fluidinfo-style policy is explicitly
given as ``open`` or ``closed``, optionally foollowed by the
word ``except`` and a list of user names on the exception list,
separated by plus signs.

Note that the owner is not treated specially, so should normally be included
in the exception list if the policy is closed.
If the owner is excluded from control, ``fish`` will refuse to make
the change unless forced with ``-f``.
::

    $ fish perms read open rating
    $ fish perms write closed except alice+miro rating
    $ fish perms control closed except alice+miro rating
    $ fish ls -L rating
    alice/rating:

    TAG (/tags)
      Write
        update (metadata):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
        delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
      Control
        control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]

    TAG (/tag-values)
      Read
        read (read):        policy: open; exceptions = []
      Write
        create (tag):       policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
        delete (untag):     policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
      Control
        control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]


**NOTES**

1. **READ (LIST) PERMISSION ON NAMESPACES**.  Removing read access to
   a namespace prevents people from listing that namespace but does
   not stop them working with the contents of the namespace if they
   can find them.  So if you have a namespace called ``secret`` and
   set its permissions to ``nrwc------`` (owner-only access) and in it
   have a tag called ``password`` with its permission set to the
   default ``trwcr--r--`` then anyone will be able to read the
   password if they discover it exists.

   This is clearly not a good situation; the Fluidinfo team is aware
   of it and I expect some resolution will be forthcoming at some point.

   Note also that the *existence* of a tag cannot really be hidden in
   Fluidinfo, so people will be able to find out that you have a tag
   called ``secret/password``.

2. **LOSING CONTROL**.   If you give someone else write into one of your
   namespaces, you should be aware that any tags or namespaces that person
   creates will, by default be under the control of that user, i.e.
   if ``alice`` creates a tag in your namespace, she will have control
   permission and write permission over it and *you will not*.

   This is a recognized failure, and will be fixed.

   In the meantime, if ``alice`` does create a tag called ``alice/a``
   in ``bert``'s namespace, she can give back shared control to
   ``bert`` by saying:
   ::

      $ fish perms write closed except alice+bert /bert/alice/a
      $ fish perms control closed except alice+bert /bert/alice/a

   She could also hand back exclusive control by saying:
   ::

       $ fish perms control closed except alice /bert/alice/a
