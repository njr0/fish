untag
*****

Removes one or more tags from the object or objects specified.

**FORM**
::

    fdb untag [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    fdb untag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -U -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen

All of these commands will remove the tags ``njr/rating``
and ``njr/seen`` from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``;
The last one may also tag other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.

The ``-U`` option specifies "unix-style" relative paths; when this option
is used, tag names are assumed to be relative to the authenticated user's
namespace; if other user's tags are to be referred to, they must be
introduced with a leading ``/`` (e.g. ``/ntoll/rating).
Note that ``-U`` does not affect queries specified with ``-q``,
i.e. full Fluidinfo-style paths must be used inside the query.

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.
::

    $ fdb untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating  
    Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
    Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTE**

The user's ability to remove tags from objects is governed by
the permissions system.
