su — sets the Fluidinfo user
****************************

Set user: changes the set of credentials in use by ``fish``.

**FORM**
::

    [fish] su userspec

**EXAMPLES**
::

    $ fish su bert

The ``fish`` command expects user credentials for Fluidinfo to be stored
in a file in the users's home directory.   On unix systems, this file
is ``~/.fluidDBcredentials``; on Windows systems it is
``fluiddbcredentials.ini`` in the user's home folder..

The the user has access to more than on Fluidinfo account, multiple
credentials may be stored in variant files.   In unix systems,
these files have names like ``~/.fluidDBcredentials.bert``;
on windows they have names like ``fluiddbcredentials-bert.ini``.

A different set of credentials can be used for any one-off command
by adding ``-u bert`` to the command line; this will cause the credentials
in the ``bert`` variant of the file to be used.

The ``fish su command`` changes the default set of credentials to be used
by copying the specified variant file over the default file.
Because it is a simple copy, this is a *global* change, i.e. it affects
all sessions, not just one in the current shell.    So on unix,
::

    su alice

is exactly equivalent to
::

   cp ~/.fluidDBcredentials.alice ~/.fluidDBcredentials
