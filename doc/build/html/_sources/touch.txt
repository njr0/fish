touch
-----

The ``touch`` command may be used to create a tag, and optionally
to set its description.

**FORM**
::

    [fish] touch path

**FLAGS**

  * ``-m description`` Sets the description (metadata) for a tag.


**EXAMPLES**

  #. Create a tag called ``njr/rating``
     ::

        $ touch njr/rating

  #. Create a tag ``njr/private/rating`` with description "keep out"
     ::

	$ touch -m "keep out"  njr/private/rating

**NOTE**

Tag creation is automatic on first use in ``fish``.
Touch is only needed, therefore, if you wish to set permissions before use
or specify a description

Touch cannot be used (at present) to change the description of an existing tag.
