rm — removes tags and namespaces
********************************

The ``rm`` command is used to remove (delete) tags and namespaces.
Namespaces normally have to be empty for this to work (unless the
``-r`` options is specified) and tags have to be unused (unless the
``-f`` option is used).

**FORM**

   [fish] rm [flags] [<namespace>|<tag>]

**FLAGS**

   * ``-r`` recurse (remove all tags and subnamespaces)

   * ``-f`` force (currently, don't complain if it doesn't exist or if
     in the case of a tag, the tag is in use.   In future, this will
     also override permissions if necessary, where possible.)

**EXAMPLES**

   1. Remove an unused tag ``njr/unused``:

         $ rm njr/unused

   2. Remove a used tag ``njr/used``, in the process removing that tag
      from all objects to which it is attached:

         $ rm -f njr/used

   3. Remove an empty namespace ``njr/empty``:

         $ rm njr/empty

   4. Remove a non-empty namespace ``njr/inUse`` and all the tags and
      namespaces under it:

         $ rm -r njr/inUse

**NOTES**

``-R`` may also be used for recurse.   (``-R`` and ``-r`` are
interchangeable on all commands in ``fish``.)

Strictly, following Unix's lead, you shouldn't have to force ``rm`` to
remove a tag that is in use, just as you can remove empty files
without a ``force`` option in Unix.  However, since a tag may be
attached to millions of objects, it seems prudent to insist.  The flag
``-r`` can also be used to force the removal of a non-empty tag since
there is also a sense in which this is a recursive remove.

The ``fish rm`` command effectively takes the place of ``rmdir`` from
Unix, as well as ``rm``.

There is no ``unrm`` command: once it's gone, it's gone. Use the
``-r`` and ``-f`` flags carefully.
