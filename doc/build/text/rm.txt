rm — removes tags and namespaces
********************************

The "rm" command is used to remove (delete) tags and namespaces.
Namespaces normally have to be empty for this to work (unless the "-r"
options is specified) and tags have to be unused (unless the "-f"
option is used).

**FORM**

   rm [flags] [<namespace>|<tag>]

**FLAGS**

   * "-r" recurse (remove all tags and subnamespaces)

   * "-f" force (currently, don't complain if it doesn't exist or if
     in the case of a tag, the tag is in use.   In future, this will
     also override permissions if necessary, where possible.)

**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as  user "alice":

   1. Remove an unused tag "alice/unused":

         $ rm unused

   2. Remove a used tag "alice/used", in the process removing that tag
      from all objects to which it is attached:

         $ rm -f used

   3. Remove an empty namespace "alice/empty":

         $ rm empty

   4. Remove a non-empty namespace "alice/inUse" and all the tags and
      namespaces under it:

         $ rm -r inUse

**NOTES**

"-R" may also be used for recurse.   ("-R" and "-r" are
interchangeable on all commands in "fish".)

Strictly, following Unix's lead, you shouldn't have to force "rm" to
remove a tag that is in use, just as you can remove empty files
without a "force" option in Unix.  However, since a tag may be
attached to millions of objects, it seems prudent to insist.  The flag
"-r" can also be used to force the removal of a non-empty tag since
there is also a sense in which this is a recursive remove.

The "fish rm" command effectively takes the place of "rmdir" from
Unix, as well as "rm".

There is no "unrm" command: once it's gone, it's gone. Use the "-r"
and "-f" flags carefully.
