mkns — makes a new namespace
****************************

The ``mkns`` command may be used to create a namespace, and optionally
to set its description. The command ``mkdir`` may be used as an
alternative.

**FORMS**

   mkns path
   mkdir path

**FLAGS**

   * ``-m description`` Sets the description (metadata) for a tag.

**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as the user ``alice``:

   1. Create a namespace called ``alice/secret``

         $ touch secret

   2. Create a tag ``alice/very/secret`` with description "keep right
      out"

         $ touch -m "keep right out"  very/secret

**NOTE**

Namespace Tag creation is automatic on first use in ``fish``.  This
command is only needed, therefore, if you wish to set permissions
before use set permissions before use or specify a description.

The ``mkns`` command cannot be used (at present) to change the
description of an existing namespace.
