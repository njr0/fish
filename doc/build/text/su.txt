fdb su
******

Set user: changes the set of credentials in use by ``fdb``.

**FORM**

   fdb su userspec

**EXAMPLES**

   fdb su foo

The ``fdb`` command expects user credentials for Fluidinfo to be
stored in a file in the users's home directory.   On unix systems,
this file is ``~/.fluidDBcredentials``; on Windows systems it is
``fluiddbcredentials.ini`` in the user's home folder..

The the user has access to more than on Fluidinfo account, multiple
credentials may be stored in variant files.   In unix systems, these
files have names like ``~/.fluidDBcredentials.foo``; on windows they
have names like ``fluiddbcredentials-foo.ini``.

A different set of credentials can be used for any one-off command by
adding ``-u foo`` to the command line; this will cause the credentials
in the ``foo`` variant of the file to be used.

The ``fdb su command`` changes the default set of credentials to be
used by copying the specified variant file over the default file.
Because it is a simple copy, this is a *global* change, i.e. it
affects all sessions, not just one in the current shell.    So on
unix,

   fdb su njr

is exactly equivalent to

   cp ~/.fluidDBcredentials.njr ~/.fluidDBcredentials
