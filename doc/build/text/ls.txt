ls — lists tags and namespaces and their properties
***************************************************

The ``ls`` command is used to view a sorted list of tags or
namespaces, potentially with additional information.

**FORM**

   [fish] ls [flags] [<namespace>|<tag>]

**FLAGS**

   * ``-l`` long listing (one per line; showing permissions)

   * ``-g`` group listing (one per line; showing exception groups and
     permissions)

   * ``-L`` longer listing (show full Fluidinfo-style permissions
     listing)

   * ``-n`` list the namesace as an object, rather than the contents
     of the namespace

   * ``-d`` same as ``-n``

   * ``-R`` recursive (show contents of all subnamespaces,
     recursively)

as well as the standard flags like ``-s`` etc.

**EXAMPLES**

   1. List the tags in the user's namespace:

      (Here, we assume we are authenticated as user ``miro``):

         $ fish ls
         bestsellers-1998-2010/    first_field_id            n_records
         bestsellers1998to2010/    first_record_id           next-field-about
         books/                    forename                  next-field-id
         class                     has-about-links           next_field_about
         consistent                has-field-numbers         next_field_id
         description               has-id-links              planets/
         elements/                 has-record-numbers        rating
         field-name                has_about_links           small/
         field-number              has_field_numbers         surname
         field_number              has_id_links              table-name
         first-field-about         has_record_numbers        testconvtag
         first-field-id            message                   testrating
         first-record-about        n-fields                  testtable/
         first-record-id           n-records                 type
         first_field_about         n_fields                  unit

      Note that namespaces are shown with a trailing ``/``; for users
      familiar with the unix ``ls`` command, this is modelled on ``ls
      -F``.

   2. List the tags and subnamespaces in a given namespace:

         $ fish ls miro/planets
         Atmosphere                Mass                      OrbitalRadius
         Category                  Moons                     RotationPeriod
         EquatorialDiameter        Name                      db-next-record-about
         HasRings                  OrbitalEccentricity       db-record-number
         Inclination               OrbitalPeriod

      Sort order is case-sensitive, e.g. (in English) all lower-case
      letters follow upper-case letters.

   3. List a single tag (report presence or absence of that tag).

         $ fish ls miro/planets/Mass
         miro/planets/Mass

         $ fish ls -F miro/planets/NoMass
         miro/planets/NoMass not found

   * Long listing for tag (``njr/rating``), including permissions
      summary:

         $ fish ls -l njr/rating
         trwcr--r--   rating

      Here:

         * the first ``t`` indicates that this is a tag rather than a
           namespace

         * the next three characters indicate that the owner (``njr``)
           has ``read``, ``write`` and ``control`` permission on the
           tag,

         * the *final* three characters indicate that everyone (world)
           has read permission but not write or control permission on
           the tag.

         * the "middle" three characters (``r--``) show group
           permissions.  Their meaning depends on the world
           permissions. Because the world has read permission the only
           thing that an exception list can do is to remove it; so in
           this case, the ``r`` in the middle ``r--`` block indicates
           that no one is losing read permission as a result of being
           on an exception list.  If there were an exception list that
           excluded some people, then the group read permission would
           be shown as ``-``.

           If the world did not have read permission, an ``r`` would
           mean that at least one person has read permission in
           addition to the owner; and a ``-`` would indicate that no
           one except the owner had read permission.

         * the final thing to know about this way of describing
           permissions is that Fluidinfo actually has more than one
           kind of write permission for both tags and namespaces, and
           more than one kind of control permission for tags.
           Normally, all the write permissions are set consistently,
           as are the two control permissions for tags. If this is not
           the case, the permission will be shown as a ``/``.

         * Use the ``-g`` flag to find out who is in the
           group/exception list, or ``-L`` for the even longer, full
           Fluidinfo description of the permissions.

   * Group long listing for tag (``njr/rating``), including
     permissions summary.

     Let's start with a tag with default permissions.

        $ fish ls -g private-tag
        trwcr--r--   (world)   njr/private-tag

     When no one has been given any unusual permissions, in effect
     there is no group; or to say it another way, group permissions
     can be considered to be the same as world permissions.

     Now let's grant read and write access to ``jkakar`` and ``ntoll``

        $ fish perms group jkakar+ntoll njr/private-tag

        $ fish ls -g private-tag
        trwcrw----   ntoll+jkakar   njr/private-tag

     Group permission is now ``rw-``, and the group is
     ``ntoll+jkakar``. (The exception list also includes ``njr``, of
     course.)

     Now let's set different groups for read and write. We'll let
     ``ntoll`` have write permission too. To do this we update the
     write group:

        $ fish perms group-write ntoll private-tag

        $ fish ls -g njr/private-tag
        trwcrw----   r:ntoll+jkakar  w:ntoll   njr/private-tag

     When the groups are different, they are shown separately, with
     ``r:`` prefixing the read group and ``w;`` prefixing the write
     group.

   * Longer listing for tag (``njr/rating``), including Fluidinfo-
     style permissions summary:

        $ fish ls -L njr/rating

        njr/rating:

        ABSTRACT TAG (/tags)
          Write
            update (metadata):  policy: closed; exceptions [njr]
            delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions [njr]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions [njr]

        TAG (/tag-values)
          Read
            read (read):        policy: open; exceptions []
          Write
            create (tag):       policy: closed; exceptions [njr]
            delete (untag):     policy: closed; exceptions [njr]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions [njr]

   * Long listing for contents of namespace (``njr/index``):

        $ fish ls -l njr/index
        trwcr--r--   about
        trwcr--r--   class

   * Group long listing for namespace (``njr/private``), including
     permissions summary.

     The ``-d`` tells ``ls`` that what you want is not the *content*
     of the namespace, but the permissions on the namespace itself.
     (``d`` stands for directory, which is essentially what a
     namespace is.  You can use ``-n`` if you prefer.)

     The result is very similar to that for tags.   We'll just look at
     a namespace ``fi``

        $ fish ls -gd njr/fi
        nrwcrw-r--   r:(world)  w:terrycojones+paparent   njr/fi/

     This is showning that the namespace njr/fi has standard world
     read permissions (with no special group) but that
     ``terrycojones`` and ``paparent`` have write permission for the
     namespace.

   * Long listing for a namespace itself (``njr/index``) (as opposed
     to its contents),  including Fluidinfo-style permissions summary:

        $ fish ls -ln njr/index
        nrwcr--r--   index

        $ fish ls -ld njr/index
        nrwcr--r--   index

     The first ``n`` indicates that ``njr/index`` is a namespace
     rather than a tag.   This option may be specified using ``-n``
     (for namespace) or ``-d`` (for directory) since the latter will
     probably be more natural for users familiar with unix-style
     ``ls``.

     See the section on permissions for an explanation of the
     permissions string.

   * Longer listing for a namespace itself (``njr/index``) (as opposed
     to its contents):

        $ fish ls -Ld njr/index

        NAMESPACE (/namespaces)
          Read
            list (read):        policy: open; exceptions []
          Write
            create (create):    policy: closed; exceptions [njr]
            delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions [njr]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions [njr]

   * Long listing including group details (for tag ``njr/rating``)

        $ fish ls -ln njr/fi
        nrwcr-----   ceronman+esteve+jkakar+ntoll+terrycojones fi

     See the section on permissions for an explanation of the
     permissions string.   In this case

        * the first ``n`` indicates that this is a namespace

        * the next three characters indicate that the owner (``njr``)
          has read, write and control permission on the tag,

        * the next three characters indicate that members of the
          exception group exceptions have read ("list") permission on
          the tag (but not write or control permissions).

        * the final three characters indicate that Fluidinfo users
          other than the owner and the people in the exception group
          do not have any permissions to read, write or control the
          namespace.

     The list of users separated by plus signs is the list of users on
     the exceptions list.

     The next example shows Fluidinfo's native representation of the
     permissions for this namespace.

   * Longer listing for namspace (``njr/fi``), including Fluidinfo-
     style permissions summary:

        $ fish ls -Ln njr/fi

        Permissions for namespace njr/fi:

        READ:
          list (read):        policy: closed; exceptions: [ceronman, esteve, jkakar, njr, ntoll, terrycojones]

        WRITE:
          create (create):    policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]
          update (metadata):  policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]
          delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]

        CONTROL:
          control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]

   * List contents of all subnamespaces (recursive descent):

        ls -R miro
