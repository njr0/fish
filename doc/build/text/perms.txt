perms
*****

The ``perms`` command provides a simple interface for changing the
permissions on tags and namespaces.   It only supports five cases, but
there are powerful enough to cover the vast bulk of common situations.

**FORM**

   fdb perms permissions-spec list-of-one-or-more-tags-or-namespaces

Here ``permissions-spec`` can be

   * ``private``

   * ``default``

   * ``lock``

   * ``unlock``

   * ``group list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses``

   * ``group-write list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses``

   * ``group-read list+of+usernames+separated+by+pluses``

**EXAMPLES**

The eight supported cases are as follows and apply equally namespaces
and tags. In what follows, we'll use a ``rating`` tag and a namespace
called ``friends``.

   * Make a tag or namespace completely private.

        $ fdb perms private njr/rating
        $ fdb perms private njr/fi

     We could also change them together by saying:

        $ fdb perms private njr/rating njr/fi

     This sets the permissions so that only the owner of the tag or
     namespace has permission to do anything with it---``read``,
     ``write`` and ``control`` permission. The abbreviated view of
     this is shown by

        $ fdb ls -ld njr/rating njr/fi
        trwc------   njr/rating
        nrwc------   njr/fi/

     (See *fdbls* for an detailed explanation of the permissions
     codes.)

     The full listing after this is:

        $ fdb -F ls -Ld njr/rating njr/fi

        njr/rating:

        ABSTRACT TAG (/tags)
          Write
            update (metadata):  policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
            delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]

        TAG (/tag-values)
          Read
            read (read):        policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
          Write
            create (tag):       policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
            delete (untag):     policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]


        njr/fi/:

        NAMESPACE (/namespaces)
          Read
            list (read):        policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
          Write
            create (create):    policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
            delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]
          Control
            control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions = [njr]

   * Restore default permissions to a tag or namespace. The default is
     that the owner has read, write and control and everyone else has
     read only:

        $ fdb perms default njr/rating njr/fi

        $ fdb -F ls -ld njr/rating njr/fi
        trwcr--r--   njr/rating
        nrwcr--r--   njr/fi/

   * Lock a namespace or tag so that it can't be edited (i.e., remove
     all write permissions).

        $ fdb perms lock njr/rating

        $fdb ls -l njr/rating
        tr-cr--r--   njr/rating

     This does not alter read or control permissions.

   * Unlock a namespace or tag so that the owner (only) can edit it.

        $ fdb perms unlock njr/rating

        $fdb ls -l njr/rating
        trwcr--r--   njr/rating

     This does not alter read or control permissions.

   * Set the permissions on a tag or namespace so that one or more
     extra people can write it.   (This does not alter read
     permissions.)

        $ fdb perms group-write ntoll+jkakar njr/rating njr/fi

        $ fdb ls -gd njr/rating njr/fi
        fdb -F ls -gd njr/rating njr/fi
        trwcrw-r--   r:(world)  w:ntoll+jkakar   njr/rating
        nrwcrw-r--   r:(world)  w:ntoll+jkakar   njr/fi/

   * Set the permissions so that only a particular group can read it,
     leaving write permissions as the are.

        $ fdb perms default njr/rating njr/fi
        $ fdb perms group-read ntoll+jkakar+miro njr/rating njr/fi

        $ fdb -F ls -gd njr/rating njr/fi
        trwcr-----   r:ntoll+jkakar+miro  w:(world)   njr/rating
        nrwcr-----   r:ntoll+jkakar+miro  w:(world)   njr/fi/

   * Set permissions so that one group of users can write tge tag or
     namespace, and another group can read it. In this case, let's
     allow ``miro`` to write and ``ntoll`` and ``jkakar`` (as well as
     ``miro``) to read.

        $ fdb perms group-read ntoll+jkakar+miro njr/rating njr/fi
        $ fdb perms group-write miro njr/rating njr/fi

        $ fdb ls -gd njr/rating njr/fi
        trwcrw----   r:ntoll+jkakar+miro  w:miro   njr/rating
        nrwcrw----   r:ntoll+jkakar+miro  w:miro   njr/fi/

   * The final case is really just a special case of the previous one,
     where the read and write groups are the same. Let's make ``miro``
     the only user (other the owner, ``njr``) who can read or write
     the tag and namespace.

        $ fdb perms group miro njr/rating njr/fi

        $ fdb ls -gd njr/rating njr/fi
        trwcrw----   miro   njr/rating
        nrwcrw----   miro   njr/fi/

**NOTE**

Removing read access to a namespace prevents people from listing that
namespace but does not stop them working with the contents of the
namespace if they can find them.   So if you have a namespace called
``secret`` and set its permissions to ``nrwc------`` (owner-only
access) and in it have a tag called ``password`` with its permission
set to the default ``trwcr--r--`` then anyone will be able to read the
password if they discover it exists.

This is clearly not a good situation; the Fluidinfo team is aware of
it and I expect some resolution will be forthcoming at some point.

Note also that the *existence* of a tag cannot really be hidden in
Fluidinfo, so people will be able to find out that you have a tag
called ``secret/password``.
