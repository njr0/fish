tag
***

Adds one or more tags (with optional values) to the object or objects
specified.

**FORM**

   fdb tag [flags] <object specifier> <tag-value-pairs>

**EXAMPLES**

   fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating=7 njr/seen
   fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating=7 njr/seen
   fdb tag -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 njr/rating=7 njr/seen
   fdb tag -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' njr/rating=7 njr/seen
   fdb tag -U -a "Eiffel Tower" rating=7 seen

All of these commands will tag the object with about tag "Eiffel
Tower" and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4`` with two
tags---``njr/rating`` of 7 and ``njr/seen`` with no value. The last
one may also tag other objects since the query

   fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other
words and punctuation.

The ``-U`` option specifies "unix-style" relative paths; when this
option is used, tag names are assumed to be relative to the
authenticated user's namespace; if other user's tags are to be
referred to, they must be introduced with a leading ``/`` (e.g.
``/ntoll/rating). Note that ``-U`` does not affect queries specified
with ``-q``, i.e. full Fluidinfo-style paths must be used inside the
query.

The command produces no output when successful and a suitable warning
when it fails.

   $ fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating=7

   $ fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating=7
   Failed to tag object with about="Eiffel Tower" with ntoll/rating
   Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTES**

When specified by about tag, the object does not need to exist in
Fluidinfo prior to the operation; if necessary an object with the
given about tag will be created.   (Conceptually, an object for every
possible about tag always exists in Fluidinfo; they are just
*instantiated lazily*, i.e. allocated IDs when first used.)

The user must have permission to write the tag. By default, the user
can write any tag under her namespace.
