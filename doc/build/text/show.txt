Shows the values of the tags nominated from the objects specified.

**FORM**

   fdb show [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**

   $ fdb show -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
   Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
     njr/rating = 7
     njr/seen
     (tag ntoll/seen not present)

Alternative specifications:

   fdb show -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
   fdb show -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
   fdb show -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
   fdb show -U -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen ntoll/seen

All of these commands will show the values the tags ``njr/rating``,
``njr/seen`` and ``ntoll/seen`` from the object with about tag "Eiffel
Tower" and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``; The last one
may also show other objects since the query

   fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other
words and punctuation.

The ``-U`` option specifies "unix-style" relative paths; when this
option is used, tag names are assumed to be relative to the
authenticated user's namespace; if other user's tags are to be
referred to, they must be introduced with a leading ``/`` (e.g.
``/ntoll/rating). Note that ``-U`` does not affect queries specified
with ``-q``, i.e. full Fluidinfo-style paths must be used inside the
query.

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.

   $ fdb untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating
   Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
   Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTE**

The user's ability to read tags is regulated by the permissions
system.
