show — shows the values of tags on objects
******************************************

Shows the values of the tags nominated from the objects specified.

**FORM**

   show [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as  user ``alice``:

   $ fish show "Eiffel Tower" rating seen bert/seen
   Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
     alice/rating = 7
     alice/seen
     (tag bert/seen not present)

Alternative specifications:

   show -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen /bert/seen
   show -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 rating seen /bert/seen
   show -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' rating seen /bert/seen
   show -F -a "Eiffel Tower" alice/rating alice/seen bert/seen
   show "Eiffel Tower" rating seen /bert/seen
   show 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 rating seen /bert/seen

All of these commands will show the values the tags ``alice/rating``,
``alice/seen`` and ``bert/seen`` from the object with about tag
"Eiffel Tower" and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``; The
last one may also show other objects since the query

   fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other
words and punctuation.

**NOTES**

The ``-F`` option specifies "Fluidinfo-style" full paths; when this
option is used, all tag names are assumed be absolute, i.e. must start
with the username.

The user's ability to read tags is regulated by the permissions
system.
