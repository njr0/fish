touch — creates a tags and optionally sets their descriptions
*************************************************************

The "touch" command may be used to create a tag, and optionally to set
its description.

**FORM**

   touch path

**FLAGS**

   * "-m description" Sets the description (metadata) for a tag.

**EXAMPLES**

When authenticated as user "alice":

   1. Create a tag called "alice/rating"

         $ touch rating

   2. Create a tag "alice/private/rating" with description "keep out"

         $ touch -m "keep out"  private/rating

**NOTE**

Tag creation is automatic on first use in "fish".  Touch is only
needed, therefore, if you wish to set permissions before use or
specify a description

Touch cannot be used (at present) to change the description of an
existing tag.
