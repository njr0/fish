The fish Command Line for Fluidinfo
***********************************


A Brief Overview of Fluidinfo
=============================

Fluidinfo is a simple, shared, online storage system in which each
there are a set of objects, each of which can optionally be *about*
something, and information is stored by tagging objects. Tags belong
to users, and have names.   Tags may store information simply by being
present or absent, or they may have values. Thus I  can indicate that
I have read a book by attaching a tag called ``have-read`` to the
object corresponding to that book, or I can rate it by attaching a
``rating`` tag with a numeric value to the object.   Tag owners can
set permissions on their tags to control who can see them and who can
alter/use them. So tags are owned and are subject to a permissions
system and policies, while all objects are shared.


Overview of the Command Line
============================

The fish command line is a acts as a sort-of one-shot command shell
for Fluidinfo.   It gives access to much of the functionality of the
underlying ``fish.py`` library, with a main focus on tagging, getting
tag values, finding tags, querying Fluidinfo and clearing (removing
tags). It also has some facilities for listing tags and viewing and
altering their permissions.

Assuming you have installed fish.py, set up a credentials file, and
created an alias ``fish`` to run it, basic use is exemplified as
follows.   In the examples that follow, I assume that the Fluidinfo
user has username ``njr``.   All tags belonging to njr start ``njr/``.
(``fish`` actually has a configuration option to allow this to be
omitted, but for now we'll specify the user explicitly, since that is
normal in Fluidinfo.)

   1. Rate the Eiffel Tower as a 9:

         $ fish tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating=9

   2. Show the my rating and ntoll's rating of the "Eiffel Tower".

         $ fish show -a "Eiffel Tower"  fluiddb/about  njr/rating  ntoll/rating
         Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
         /objects/93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
         njr/rating = 9
         fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"
         ntoll/rating = "I prefer the one in Blackpool"

   3. Show all the tags on the "Eiffel Tower" (now referenced by ID):

         $ fish tags -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
         Object with id=93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4:
         njr/rating = 9
         ntoll/rating = "I prefer the  the one in Blackpool"
         njr/location = "Paris"
         njr/indexed/about
         fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"

   4. Add a ``dislike`` tag to each object that I have rated 1 or 0
      and then show their about tags.

         $ fish tag -q 'njr/rating < 2' njr/dislike
         $ fish show -q 'has njr/dislike' fluiddb/about njr/rating njr/dislike
         5 objects matched
         Object a98f2c80-ae5f-405a-a319-d47122ae9da3:
           fluiddb/about = "book:foucaults pendulum (umberto eco)"
           njr/rating = 1
           njr/dislike = True
         Object 5157c69e-ceaf-4e7c-9423-d67751d029d3:
           fluiddb/about = "The_Beatles"
           njr/rating = 1
           njr/dislike = True
         Object 1ab066e8-c2a1-4769-9121-e3346849e7e4:
           fluiddb/about = "book:beloved (toni morrison)"
           njr/rating = 1
           njr/dislike = True
         Object ff873602-e9a8-4f9a-a7d4-c0cfc394a120:
           fluiddb/about = "book:the lord of the rings (jrr tolkien)"
           njr/rating = 1
           njr/dislike = True
         Object 7aed1e67-a88e-439d-8a56-b2ab52c838ab:
           fluiddb/about = "book:oranges are not the only fruit (jeanette winterson)"
           njr/rating = 0
           njr/dislike = True

Before describing these commands in detail, it will be useful to
describe the abstraction ``fish`` uses, as it differs in key respects
from the underlying Fluidinfo model.


The fish Abstraction
====================

The Fluidinfo API is quite low level and rigid; ``fish`` offers a
slightly higher level of abstraction. Here, we briefly note the
differences.

   * In the Fluidinfo API, you can't simply tag an object with an
     ``njr/rating`` tag; you first have to tell the system that you
     wish to use a ``rating`` tag by ``creating`` it; only once you
     have done this can you use it.

     In ``fish``, you can just go ahead and set a tag; if it doesn't
     exist, the system will create it for you.

   3. Fluidinfo supports *namespaces*; a namespace is to a tag much
     like a directory or folder is to a file, i.e. tags live in
     namespaces and you can have different tags with the same name in
     different namspaces, just as you can have two files with the same
     name in different folders.   User Jacqui (username ``jacqui``)
     has a namespace ``jacqui``, and she can create tags ("top-level
     tags") in that namespace.   Jacqui may, however, wish to group
     tags into sets using namespaces.   For example, she may wish to
     have some private tags that all live in a namespace called
     ``private``.   So she might have a private rating tag called
     ``jacqui/private/rating``. As with tags, Fluidinfo first requires
     jacqui to create the ``private`` namespace before she can create
     the ``jacqui/private/rating`` tag. So to use
     ``jacqui/private/rating`` for the first time, using the API
     directly, the process would be:

        1. Create the namespace ``private`` under ``jacqui``

        2. Create the tag ``rating``

        3. Tag the relevant object with ``rating``.

      Again, ``fish`` takes care of all that, and allows jacqui just
      to say:

         fish tag -a "Eiffel Tower" jacqui/rating=10

      ``fish`` will create any tags and namespaces required on the
      fly.

   * Finally, in Fluidinfo itself, the object ID (128-bit number,
     usually formatted as a hex-number in 8-4-4-4-12 digit groups) is
     not actually a tag on the object.   ``fish`` allows the user to
     use refer to it as a tag, at least for reporting purposes, using
     the name ``/id``.


The Anatomy of the core fish Commands
=====================================

The general form of the core fish commands is:

   fish <verb> [flags] <object selector> <tags/values>

The verb says what you want to do.   The main verbs currently
avalaible are

   * ``tag`` --- set tags on some objects

   * ``show`` --- show tag values from some objects

   * ``untag`` --- remove tags from some objects

   * ``tags`` --- show what readable tags an object has

   * ``count`` --- count the number of objects match some criterion.

The optional ``flags`` modify the command.   The main ones used are:

   * ``-v`` --- verbose (gives extra information)

   * ``-s`` --- to specify that the command should operate againss the
     sandbox (``sandbox.fluidinfo.com``) rather than the main
     Fluidinfo instance (``fluiddb.fluidinfo.com``); this is mostly
     used for testing.

   * ``-U`` --- use unix-style paths (overriding configuration and
     default; see below)

   * ``-F`` --- use Fluidinfo-style paths (overriding configuration
     and default; see below)

   * ``-u userspec`` --- if you have multiple Fluidinfo accounts, this
     specifies an alternate credentials file to use, normally
     identified by the username (see below).

The ``<object selector>`` is used to specify which objects you are
interested in and usually takes on of three forms:

   * ``-a "about tag value"`` is used to specify an object on the
     basis of its about tag (``fluiddb/about``).   For example, ``-a
     "book:nineteen eighty four (george orwell)"`` specifies an
     important book by George Orwell.

   * ``-i ID`` is used to specify an object on the basis of its ID
     (expressed as a hex string, appropriately formatted). For
     example, ``-i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4`` specifies
     the object with this ID, which happens to be the on with the
     about tag ``Eiffel Tower``.

   * ``-q "fluidinfo query"`` is used to specify a set of objects on
     the basis of a query expressed in the Fluidinfo query language.
     For example ``-q has njr/rating`` specifies objects that have an
     njr/rating rag on them.

Finally, some commands need or accept a list of tags or tag-value
pairs. Specifically, ``show`` and ``untag`` both require a list of
tags to be shown or removed, and ``tag`` requires a set of tag-value
pairs to know what tags to set.   Tag value pairs usually take the
form:

   tag=value

so that a list of them might be

   rating=9 description="fabulous" seen=true price=18.77

Don't put spaces around equals signs assigning tag values: it won't
work.

In general, strings should be in double quotes ``"like this"``,
booleans should be ``true``, ``false``, ``t`` or ``f`` (unquoted) and
numbers should just be plain numbers like 3 or 4.7. All strings are
always unicode, i.e. they may contain any character.

It is also possible to set a tag without a value by just giving a tag
name.
