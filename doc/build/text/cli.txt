An Overview of the Fish Command Line for Fluidinfo
**************************************************


A Brief Overview of Fluidinfo
=============================

Fluidinfo is a simple, shared, online storage system in which each
there are a set of objects, each of which can optionally be *about*
something, and information is stored by tagging objects. Tags belong
to users, and have names. Tags may store information simply by being
present or absent, or they may have values. Thus I can indicate that I
have read a book by attaching a tag called "have-read" to the object
corresponding to that book, or I can rate it by attaching a "rating"
tag with a numeric value to the object. Tag owners can set permissions
on their tags to control who can see them and who can alter/use them.
So tags are owned and are subject to a permissions system and
policies, while all objects are shared.


Overview of the Fish Command Line
=================================

The Fish command line normally acts as a sort-of one-shot command
shell for Fluidinfo. It gives access to much of the functionality of
the underlying "fishlib.py" library, with a main focus on tagging,
getting tag values, finding tags, querying Fluidinfo and clearing
(removing tags). It also has some facilities for listing tags and
viewing and altering their permissions.

Assuming you have installed "fish.py", set up a credentials file, and
created an alias "fish" to run it, basic use is exemplified as
follows. In the examples that follow, I assume that the Fluidinfo user
has username "alice". All tags belonging to alice start "alice/".

   1. Rate the Eiffel Tower as a 9:

         $ fish tag "Eiffel Tower" rating=9

   2. Show the my rating and ntoll's rating of the "Eiffel Tower".

         $ fish show "Eiffel Tower"  /about  rating  /ntoll/rating
         Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
         /objects/93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
         alice/rating = 9
         fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"
         ntoll/rating = "I prefer the one in Blackpool"

   3. Show all the tags on the "Eiffel Tower" (now referenced by ID):

         $ fish tags 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
         Object with id=93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4:
         alice/rating = 9
         ntoll/rating = "I prefer the  the one in Blackpool"
         alice/location = "Paris"
         alice/indexed/about
         fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"

   4. Add a "dislike" tag to each object that I have rated 1 or 0 and
      then show their about tags.

         $ fish tag -q 'alice/rating < 2' dislike
         $ fish show -q 'has alice/dislike' /about rating dislike
         5 objects matched
         Object a98f2c80-ae5f-405a-a319-d47122ae9da3:
           fluiddb/about = "book:foucaults pendulum (umberto eco)"
           alice/rating = 1
           alice/dislike = True
         Object 5157c69e-ceaf-4e7c-9423-d67751d029d3:
           fluiddb/about = "The_Beatles"
           alice/rating = 1
           alice/dislike = True
         Object 1ab066e8-c2a1-4769-9121-e3346849e7e4:
           fluiddb/about = "book:beloved (toni morrison)"
           alice/rating = 1
           alice/dislike = True
         Object ff873602-e9a8-4f9a-a7d4-c0cfc394a120:
           fluiddb/about = "book:the lord of the rings (jrr tolkien)"
           alice/rating = 1
           alice/dislike = True
         Object 7aed1e67-a88e-439d-8a56-b2ab52c838ab:
           fluiddb/about = "book:oranges are not the only fruit (jeanette winterson)"
           alice/rating = 0
           alice/dislike = True

Before describing these commands in detail, it will be useful to
describe the abstraction "fish" uses, as it differs in key respects
from the underlying Fluidinfo model.


The Anatomy of the core Fish Commands
=====================================

The general form of the core Fish commands is:

   fish <verb> [flags] <object selector> <tags/values>

The verb says what you want to do. The main verbs currently available
are

   * "tag" --- set tags on some objects

   * "show" --- show tag values from some objects

   * "untag" --- remove tags from some objects

   * "tags" --- show what readable tags an object has

   * "count" --- count the number of objects match some criterion.

The optional "flags" modify the command. The main ones used are:

   * "-v" --- verbose (gives extra information)

   * "-s" --- to specify that the command should operate against the
     sandbox ("sandbox.fluidinfo.com") rather than the main Fluidinfo
     instance ("fluiddb.fluidinfo.com"); this is mostly used for
     testing.

   * "-U" --- use unix-style paths (overriding configuration and
     default; see below)

   * "-F" --- use Fluidinfo-style paths (overriding configuration and
     default; see below)

   * "-u userspec" --- if you have multiple Fluidinfo accounts, this
     specifies an alternate credentials file to use, normally
     identified by the username (see below).

The "<object selector>" is used to specify which objects you are
interested in and can take any of five different forms:

   1. "almost anything you like that doesn't start with "-"". By far
      the most easiest and most common way to specify an object is
      simply by making the first argument to the command its *about*
      tag.

      More specifically, if you don't use any of the selector flags
      "-a", "-i", "-q``or ``-@", Fish will take the first argument
      after the command and treat it as either an *about* tag value or
      an ID. Its criteria for choosing are very simple: if the form of
      that value is

         hhhhhhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhh

      where each "h" is a hex digit "0–f" (in lower case), it will be
      assumed to be an object ID; otherwise it will be taken to be an
      *about* tag.

   2. "-a "about tag value"" is used to specify an object specifically
      on the basis of its *about* tag ("fluiddb/about"). For example,
      "-a "book:nineteen eighty four (george orwell)"" specifies an
      important book by George Orwell.

      The main reason to do this would be if you wanted to tag an
      object with an about tag that has the exact form of an Object
      ID. This is a truly terrible idea, and I strongly recommend
      against it. If you do it, you will end up tagging and object
      with an *about* tag that has the form of an object ID, but whose
      actual ID will (with probability 1.0000000) be different. In the
      future, it is likely that object IDs and *about* tags will be
      merged into a single identifier, at which point data written on
      such objects will be at risk.

   * "-i ID" is used to specify an object on the basis of its D
     (expressed as a hex string, appropriately formatted). For
     example, "-i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4" specifies the
     object with this ID, which happens to be the n with the about tag
     "Eiffel Tower".

   * "-q "fluidinfo query"" is used to specify a set of objects n the
     basis of a query expressed in the Fluidinfo query language. or
     example "-q has alice/rating" specifies objects that have an
     "alice/rating" tag on them.

   * "-@" is used to specify a single new object having no *about*
     tag. or example, if Jacqui says:

        $ fish tag -@ private/note="Sometimes a girl needs a little privacy"

     then Fish will respond with a message something like the
     following:

        Tagged object ebd22382-87f9-46f5-a6da-e330671dd8b7 with private/note = "Sometimes a girl needs a little privacy"

     Here, "ebd22382-87f9-46f5-a6da-e330671dd8b7" is the ID of a new
     object that Fluidinfo will create. It has no *about* tag and
     never will have. If you use only private tags (ones that others
     can't read), you can ave a very high degree of confidence that no
     one else will ever find our object. So this is a good place to
     store data if you are very confident you will never want to share
     it with anyone else.

Finally, some commands need or accept a list of tags or tag-value
pairs. Specifically, "show" and "untag" both require a list of tags to
be shown or removed, and "tag" requires a set of tag-value pairs to
know what tags to set. Tag value pairs usually take the form:

   tag=value

so that a list of them might be

   rating=9 description="fabulous" seen=true price=18.77

Don't put spaces around equals signs assigning tag values: it won't
work.

In general, strings should be in double quotes ""like this"", booleans
should be "true", "false", "t" or "f" (unquoted) and numbers should
just be plain numbers like 3 or 4.7. All strings are always unicode,
i.e. they may contain any character.

It is also possible to set a tag without a value by just giving a tag
name.


Invoking Fish as a Shell
========================

If Fish is invoked without any arguments, simply by typing

   $ fish

then Fish starts as an interactive shell in which the user can enter a
commands without the "fish" prefix at the start of the line. For
example:

   $ fish
   This is fish version 0.00.
   > pwd
   alice
   > show 'book:alices adventures in wonderland (lewis carroll)' rating
   Object with about="book:alices adventures in wonderland (lewis carroll)":
   alice/rating = 10
   > quit

Key things to know about the interactive shell are:

   * When the "readline" library is available, it will be used,
     meaning that you will be able to use either Emacs key bindings or
     the arrow keys to edit the command line, including moving up and
     down through the command history.

   * Again, if the "readline" library is available, a "history"
     command will be available, to show you previous commands that you
     have used in the session; this may also be abbreviated to "h".

   * Quoting and escaping follow the following rules:

        * Either single or double quotes can be used to make compound
          arguments; single quotes can be enclosed in double quotes
          and double quotes can be enclosed in single quotes, e.g.

             tag "Occam's Razor" comment="I'm a believer"
             tag 'The "double" quote' comment='Is "doubleplusgood"'

        * The escape character is blackslash ("\"), which can be used
          to escape quotes or backslashes. For example, this command:

             tag "The \"backslash\" (\\) character" comment="is used for escaping"

          tags the object with about tag "The "backslash" (\)
          character".

        * Left quotes (*backticks*) can be used to allow command
          substitution, whereby the phrase enclosed in backticks is
          evaluated as a Fish command and the output of that command
          replaces the quoted phrase when the enclosing command is
          executed. For example:

             tag "`about book 'Animal Farm' 'George Orwell'`" rating=10

          tags the object with about tag "book:animal farm (george
          orwell)", since that is the result of the quoted Fish
          "about" command.
