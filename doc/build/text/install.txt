Installation and Configuration
******************************

**IMPORTANT CHANGE** From version 4.00 onwards, Fluidinfo has reverted
to its original design behaviour and uses unix-style paths by default.
See under Credentials for details.


Download
========

Fish is available from Github at https://github.com/njr0/fish (use the
download button).   The main program is "fish.py" in the top level
folder and the "fish" script, which simply executes "fish.py".


Dependencies
============

If you're running python 2.6, "fish.py" should just run.   With
earlier version of python, you need to get access to "simplejson" and
"httplib2". You can get simplejson from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/ and httplib2 from
http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/.

If you wish to use Amazon command (for finding about tags for books
and music items from Amazon product pages) you will also need the
abouttag library to be available on your python path. This is
available from http://github.com/njr0/abouttag.


Making the Fish command available
=================================

The file "fish" included in the download is executable provided that a
suitable python is installed.    You can make it available more
conveniently by using a shell alias or adding a symbolic link to it
somewhere on your "PATH".   For example:

   alias fish='/path/to/fish'

or, if "~/bin" is on your "PATH":

   cd ~/bin
   ln -s /path/to/fish


The Fish Python Library and Command Line
========================================

Fish is a primarily a command line tool for providing access to the
Fluidinfo data store (from Fluidinfo (http://fluidinfo.com/.) There is
lots of coverage of the library (and its evolution) at
http://blog.abouttag.com/.

Fish can also be used as a python library for accessing Fluidinfo, but
it is less complete and less conventional the Ali Afshar's FOM library
(https://launchpad.net/fom), which is generally preferred for
programmatic use.


Credentials
===========

For many operations, you also need an account on FluidDB, and
credentials (a username and password).   You can get these from

   http://fluidinfo.com/accounts/new

Fish expects your credentials to be available in a two-line file in
the format

username password

On Unix-like operating systems (including Mac OS X), the default
location for this is "~/.fluidDBcredentials".

On windows, the lcoation of the credentials file is specified by the
environment variable "FDB_CREDENTIALS_FILE"; if that is not set, the
Fish looks for "c:\fish\credentials.txt".

You can also optionally add a line, after password, saying either

unix-style-paths true or unix-style-paths false

(see next section).   If this is not set, unix-style paths will be
used.

If you want to use multiple Fluidinfo accounts, store extra sets of
credentials in files with an extra extention corresponding to the user
name. For example, if you want to use accounts "alice" and "bob" store
Alice's credentials in "~/.fluidDBcredentials.alice" and Bob's in
"~/.fluidDBcredentials.bob".   The "su" command will then copy the
appropriate set of credentials to "~/.fluidDBcredentials". When
operating in this mode, you also have the option of setting the
environment variable "FISHUSER" to "alice" or "bob", and that will
cause Fish to user those credentials.   This allows different shell
instances to use different users, should you need that.


Tag Conventions
===============

As from version 4.00, Fish uses Unix-style paths by default (i.e. tag
paths without a leading slash are assumed to be in the authenticated
user's namespace; tags for other users need to be prefixed with  a
leading slash). You can explicitly mandate this also by adding the
line

   unix-style-paths true

in your credentials file (see above). If you instead set

   unix-style-paths false

on the third line of the credentials file, Fish uses unix-style paths,
meaning that paths are assumed to be relative to the user's namespace
unless they are introduced with a leading slash.  Also, the about tag
(fluiddb/about) may be referred to as /about.  This affects input and
output.

If you want to overrride this behaviour for a given command, you can
use the "-U" flag to specify that the command will use unix-style
paths, or "-F" to indicate that it will use fluidinfo-style paths.


Tests
=====

The library includes a set of tests.   If you have valid credentials,
and everything is OK, these should run successfully if you just
execute the file "testfish.py" or say

   python fish.py test

See *test — runs fish's test suite*.


Using the Library
=================

Four ways of exploring the library are:

   1. look at the tests (the ones in the class "TestFluidDB")

   2. look at the blog (http://abouttag.blogspot.com)

   3. read the function documentation in the source.

   4. look at and run "example.py", which should print DADGAD and 10.


Documentation
=============

This documentation is included with the release in the "doc"
subdirectory of with "doc/build/html/index.html" being the main web
page.


Delicious
=========

Also distributed with Fish itself is code for accessing delicious.com
(http://del.icio.us/, as was), and for migrating bookmarks and other
data to FluidDB.   This also includes functionality for creating web
homepages from delicious based on a home tag.   See the README-
DELICIOUS file for details on this functionality.
