tags — shows all the tags on an object with their values
********************************************************

Show the list of tags (and their values) present on an objects

**FORM**
::

    [fish] tag [flags] <object specifier>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    $ fish tags -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
    Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
    /objects/93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
      njr/seen
      fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"
      njr/njr/seen
      njr/rating = 7
      njr/index/about
      njr/location = "Paris"


Alternative specifications:
::

    tags -a "Eiffel Tower"
    tags -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
    tags -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"'

**NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS* Working from a Windows command line, single quotes
do not work as above.   Instead you need to use double quotes and "stutter"
quotes inside quotes.   So the last example becomes:
::

    tags -q "fluiddb/about matches """Eiffel Tower"""


All of these commands will show the names and values of all the tags
(for which the user has read permission)
from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``;
The last one may also show other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.
