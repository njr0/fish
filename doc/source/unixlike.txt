Using Unix-Like Paths
=====================

In Fluidinfo itself, all paths (namespaces and tags) are absolute and
have no leading slash.  So ``alice`'s rating tag is ``alice/rating`` and
must always be specified as such.

This contrasts with Unix, where there is a notion of relative and absolute
paths.   Absolute paths start with a slash and specify how to get to
the item you are interested in.   So, if we map namespaces to directories
and tags to files, then the unix equivalent of ``alice/rating`` is
``/alice/rating``.   But Unix also has a notion of a ``current working
directory`` (``cwd``) and relative paths---the path to the file or directory
of interest relative to the working directory.   Thus if the ``cwd`` is
``alice``, then ``/alice/rating`` can be referred to as ``rating``.
Unix uses the ``cd`` command to allow you to change your working directory,
and ``pwd`` to print the name of the working directory.

The default behaviour of Fish is the support a limited version of
the unix-like behaviour.  There are two ways to tell Fish that you
would like to use fluidinfo-style paths rather than unix-style paths.
First, on any command line, you can add a ``-F`` flag, and this will
have the desired effect for that command only.  Thus, when authenticated
as the user ``alice``, the commands
::

    ls -l rating

and
::

    ls -F -l alice/rating

have the same effect.  (The ``-F`` and ``-l`` can also be combined as
``-lF`` or ``-Fl`` since they are single letter flags that don't take
arguments.)

Alternatively, if you would always like to use fluidinfo-style paths,
you can add a third line to your `Credentials` file saying
::

  unix-style-paths false


The Differences Between Using Unix-Style Paths and Fluidinfo-style Paths
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the default use unix-style paths, the following behaviours
occur:

  * All paths not beginning with a ``/`` are taken to be relative
    to the user's namespace.   So if you authenticate as ``alice``,
    then ``rating`` is a shorthand for ``/alice/rating``
    (the Fluidinfo tag ``alice/rating``),
    ``private/rating`` is a shorthand for ``/alice/private/rating``.

  * Paths in other users' namespaces must be introduced with a slash.
    Thus, to refer to ``jacqui``'s rating, use ``/jacqui/rating`` etc.
    For example,
    ::

       fish show -a DADGAD rating /jacqui/rating

    will request the Fluidinfo tags ``alice/rating`` and ``jacqui/rating``.

  * The *about tag*, ``fluiddb/about`` may be referred to with the
    special abbreviation ``/about``.
    For example,
    ::

       fish show -a DADGAD rating /jacqui/rating /about

    (though requesting the about tag for an object specified by about
    tag is obviously a bit pointless).

  * The pseudo-tag ``/id`` may be used to request the object's ID.
    (This is also available when not using unix-style paths, in fact.)

  * The exception to this is in the body of queries: Fish does not
    rewrite queries, which are passed directly to Fluidinfo.
    Thus, to request the about tags for all objects containing DADGAD,
    you would say:
    ::

       fish show -q 'fluiddb/about matches "DADGAD"' /about

    Similarly, to request all objects ``alice`` has rated 10:
    ::

       fish show -q 'alice/rating = 10' /about 

**NOTES**

  * At present, although there is a ``pwd`` command, it always simply
    returns the authenticated user's username; there is no ``cd``
    command at present.   This may change.

  * It is quite likely that at some point in the future, when unix paths
    are in use, Fish will rewrite queries too, i.e. unix-style
    paths will be extended to the query; however, that is a slightly more
    delicate operation, so hasn't been tackled yet.
