.. _fishseq:

seq — adds to a sequence
************************

Adds the next item to a sequence.

**FORM**
::

    seq sequence-name "Item to add to the sequence"

where ``sequence-name`` is the name of a sequence previously created
with the ``mk-seq`` command.

Fish sequences are simply numbered sequences of strings that are added
to conveniently using Fish commands.   Although they can be deleted
and edited by the user (using Fish or any other tools), the are primarily
designed to be added to and rarely or never amended.

The basic usage is as follows:

**EXAMPLE**
::

    $ fish mkseq remark remarks private/remark
    Next remark number: 0

    $ fish remark "Isn't this a remarkable first remark"
    0: Isn't this a remarkable first remark
    2011-12-18

    $ fish remark "...and this only slightly less remarkable"
    1: ...and this only slightly less remarkable
    2011-12-18

    $ fish remarks
    0: Isn't this a remarkable first remark
    2011-12-18

    1: ...and this only slightly less remarkable
    2011-12-18

The first command creates a sequence, consisting of a Fish alias 'remark'
for adding a new remark, 'remarks' for listing and searching remarks
and a set of tags for keeping track of remarks.   The tag used
will be ``private/remark`` in this case.

The first item in the sequence is stored on the object with about tag
``0`` and subsequent ones obects with *about* tags 1, 2, ...

Thus if we look at the object with *about* tag 1, we see:
::

   $ fish show -a 1 private/remark private/remark-date private/remark-number
   Object with about="1":
     /njr/private/remark = "...and this only slightly less remarkable"
     /njr/private/remark-date = 20111218.2035
     /njr/private/remark-number = 1

As you can see, the date is stored as a real value, with the integer
part representing the date and the fractional part representing the time
(to the nearest minute) at which the item in sequence was added.

The next item in the sequence is stored on the object *about* the user:
::

   $ fish show -q 'has njr0/private/remark-next' /about /njr0/private/remark-next
   1 object matched
   Object 6f4a87e5-98d7-40d6-8e7c-2931dad8ede3:
     /fluiddb/about = "Object for the user named njr0"
     /njr0/private/remark-next = 3
