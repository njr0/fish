showcache — shows the contents of the Fish cache
************************************************

The show cache command shows the contents of Fish's cache,
which is a local copy of aliases and other configuration information
used to personalize Fish.

    showcache

The cache file is stored in ``~/.fishcache.username`` on Unix-like systems
(including Macs) and in ``c:\\fish\\fishcache-username`` on Windows systems.

**EXAMPLE**
::

   $ fish showcache
   Cache:

     fluiddb/about="plp":
         njr/.fish/alias = "show -q "has njr/lastpage" /about"

     fluiddb/about="thought":
         njr/.fish/alias = "seq private/thought"

     fluiddb/about="book":
         njr/.fish/alias = "abouttag book"

     fluiddb/about="parisrating":
         njr/.fish/alias = "show -a "Paris" rating"

     fluiddb/about="thoughts":
