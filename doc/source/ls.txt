ls — lists tags and namespaces and their properties
***************************************************

The ``ls`` command is used to view a sorted list of tags or namespaces,
potentially with additional information.

**FORM**
::

    [fish] ls [flags] [<namespace>|<tag>]

**FLAGS**

  * ``-l`` long listing (one per line; showing permissions)
  * ``-g`` group listing (one per line; showing exception groups and permissions)
  * ``-L`` longer listing (show Fluidinfo-style permissions listing, as compactly as possible)
  * ``-G`` longest listing (show full Fluidinfo-style permissions listing)
  * ``-n`` list the namesace as an object, rather than the contents of the namespace
  * ``-d`` same as ``-n``
  * ``-R`` recursive (show contents of all subnamespaces, recursively)

as well as the standard flags like ``-s`` etc.

**EXAMPLES**

  #. List the tags in the user's namespace:

     (Here, we assume we are authenticated as user ``miro``):
     ::
  
       $ fish ls
       bestsellers-1998-2010/    first_field_id            n_records                
       bestsellers1998to2010/    first_record_id           next-field-about         
       books/                    forename                  next-field-id            
       class                     has-about-links           next_field_about         
       consistent                has-field-numbers         next_field_id            
       description               has-id-links              planets/                 
       elements/                 has-record-numbers        rating                   
       field-name                has_about_links           small/                   
       field-number              has_field_numbers         surname                  
       field_number              has_id_links              table-name               
       first-field-about         has_record_numbers        testconvtag              
       first-field-id            message                   testrating               
       first-record-about        n-fields                  testtable/               
       first-record-id           n-records                 type                     
       first_field_about         n_fields                  unit
     
     Note that namespaces are shown with a trailing ``/``; for users familiar
     with the unix ``ls`` command, this is modelled on ``ls -F``.

  #. List the tags and subnamespaces in a given namespace:
     ::
     
       $ fish ls /miro/planets
       Atmosphere                Mass                      OrbitalRadius            
       Category                  Moons                     RotationPeriod           
       EquatorialDiameter        Name                      db-next-record-about     
       HasRings                  OrbitalEccentricity       db-record-number         
       Inclination               OrbitalPeriod
   
     Sort order is case-sensitive, e.g. (in English) all lower-case letters
     follow upper-case letters.
     Miro's top-level namespace can be specifed by ``ls /miro``.

  #. List a single tag (report presence or absence of that tag).
     ::

       $ fish ls /miro/planets/Mass
       miro/planets/Mass

       $ fish ls -F miro/planets/NoMass
       miro/planets/NoMass not found

  #. Long listing for tag (``alice/rating``), including permissions summary:
     ::
    
       $ fish ls -l rating
       trwcr--r--   alice/rating
    
     Here:
    
      * the first ``t`` indicates that this is a tag rather
        than a namespace
    
      * the next three characters indicate that the owner (``alice``)
        has ``read``, ``write`` and ``control`` permission on the tag,
    
      * the *final* three characters indicate that everyone (world)
        has read permission but not write or control permission
        on the tag.

      * the "middle" three characters (``r--``) show group
        permissions.  Their meaning depends on the world permissions.
        Because the world has read permission the only thing that an
        exception list can do is to remove it; so in this case, the
        ``r`` in the middle ``r--`` block indicates that no one is losing
        read permission as a result of being on an exception list.  If
        there were an exception list that excluded some people, then
        the group read permission would be shown as ``-``.

	If the world did not have read permission, an ``r`` would
        mean that at least one person has read permission
	in addition to the owner; and a ``-`` would indicate
        that no one except the owner had read permission.

      * the final thing to know about this way of describing permissions
        is that Fluidinfo actually has more than one kind of write
        permission for both tags and namespaces, and more than one
	kind of control permission for tags.
	Normally, all the write permissions are set consistently,
	as are the two control permissions for tags.
	If this is not the case, the permission will be shown as
	a ``/``.

      * Use the ``-g`` flag to find out who is in the group/exception list,
        or ``-L`` for the even longer, full Fluidinfo description of
	the permissions.

  #. Group long listing for tag (``alice/rating``), including permissions
     summary.

     Let's start with a tag with default permissions.
     ::

        $ fish ls -g private-tag
        trwcr--r--   (world)   alice/private-tag

     When no one has been given any unusual permissions, in effect
     there is no group; or to say it another way, group permissions
     can be considered to be the same as world permissions.

     Now let's grant read and write access to ``jkakar`` and ``ntoll``
     ::

        $ fish perms group jkakar+ntoll private-tag

        $ fish ls -g private-tag
        trwcrw----   ntoll+jkakar   alice/private-tag

     Group permission is now ``rw-``, and the group is ``ntoll+jkakar``.
     (The exception list also includes ``alice``, of course.)

     Now let's set different groups for read and write.
     We'll let ``ntoll`` have write permission too.
     To do this we update the write group:
     ::

        $ fish perms group-write ntoll private-tag

        $ fish ls -g private-tag
        trwcrw----   r:ntoll+jkakar  w:ntoll   alice/private-tag

     When the groups are different, they are shown separately,
     with ``r:`` prefixing the read group and ``w;`` prefixing the
     write group.
    

  #. Longer listing for tag (``alice/rating``), including Fluidinfo-style
     permissions summary:
     ::
    
       $ fish ls -L rating
    
       alice/rating:
            read: policy: open; exceptions = []
           write: policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
         control: policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]

     Where all the low-level write permissions identical,
     and both low-level control permissions are the same,
     Fish whill show the compact listing shown here; if they are not,
     the *longest* listing, normally generated by ``-G`` is shown
     (see below).

  #. Longest listing for tag (``alice/rating``), including Fluidinfo-style
     permissions summary:
     ::
     
        $ fish ls -G rating

        alice/rating:

        TAG (/tags)
          Write
            update (metadata):   policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
            delete (delete):     policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
          Control
            control (acontrol):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]

        TAG (/tag-values)
          Read
            read (read):         policy: open; exceptions = []
          Write
            create (tag):        policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
            delete (untag):      policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]
          Control
            control (tcontrol):  policy: closed; exceptions = [alice, miro]

  #. Long listing for contents of namespace (``alice/index``):
     ::
     
       $ fish ls -l index
       trwcr--r--   about
       trwcr--r--   class
     
  #. Group long listing for namespace (``alice/private``), including permissions
     summary.

     The ``-d`` tells ``ls`` that what you want is not the *content*
     of the namespace, but the permissions on the namespace itself.
     (``d`` stands for directory, which is essentially what a
     namespace is.  You can use ``-n`` if you prefer.)

     The result is very similar to that for tags.   We'll just look at
     a namespace ``fi``
     ::

        $ fish ls -gd fi
        nrwcrw-r--   r:(world)  w:terrycojones+paparent   alice/fi/

     This is showning that the namespace ``alice/fi`` has standard world read
     permissions (with no special group) but that ``terrycojones``
     and ``paparent`` have write permission for the namespace.

  #. Long listing for a namespace itself (``alice/index``) (as opposed to
     its contents),  including Fluidinfo-style permissions summary:
     ::     

        $ fish ls -ln index
        nrwcr--r--   index
    
        $ fish ls -ld index
        nrwcr--r--   index
    
     The first ``n`` indicates that ``alice/index`` is a namespace rather than
     a tag.   This option may be specified using ``-n`` (for namespace)
     or ``-d`` (for directory) since the latter will probably be more natural
     for users familiar with unix-style ``ls``.
    
     See the section on permissions for an explanation of the permissions
     string.

  #. Longer listing for a namespace itself (``alice/index``) (as opposed to
     its contents):
     ::

        $ fish ls -Ld index

        alice/index/:
             read: policy: open; exceptions = []
            write: policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]
          control: policy: closed; exceptions = [alice]

     Where all the low-level write permissions identical, Fish
     whish the compact listing shown here; if they are not,
     the *longest* listing, normally generated by ``-G`` is shown
     (see below).


  #. Long listing including group details (for tag ``alice/rating``)
     ::
    
       $ fish ls -ln fi
       nrwcr-----   ceronman+esteve+jkakar+ntoll+terrycojones fi
    
     See the section on permissions for an explanation of the permissions
     string.   In this case
    
      * the first ``n`` indicates that this is a namespace
    
      * the next three characters indicate that the owner (``alice``)
        has read, write and control permission on the tag,
    
      * the next three characters indicate that members of the
        exception group exceptions have read ("list") permission
        on the tag (but not write or control permissions).
    
      * the final three characters indicate that Fluidinfo users
        other than the owner and the people in the exception group
        do not have any permissions to read, write or control the namespace.
    
     The list of users separated by plus signs is the list of
     users on the exceptions list.

     The next example shows Fluidinfo's native representation of the
     permissions for this namespace.

  #. Longest listing for namspace (``alice/fi``), including Fluidinfo-style
     permissions summary:
     ::
    
       $ fish ls -Ln fi
    
       Permissions for namespace alice/fi:
    
       READ:
         list (read):        policy: closed; exceptions: [ceronman, esteve, jkakar, alice, ntoll, terrycojones]
    
       WRITE:
         create (create):    policy: closed; exceptions: [alice]
         update (metadata):  policy: closed; exceptions: [alice]
         delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions: [alice]
    
       CONTROL:
         control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions: [alice]

  #. List contents of all subnamespaces (recursive descent):
     ::
