** IMPORTANT CHANGE IN VERSION 2.00: SEE TAG CONVENTIONS **

FISH PYTHON LIBRARY
===================

Fish is a primarily a command line tool for providing access to the
Fluidinfo data store (from Fluidinfo (http://fluidinfo.com/.)
There is lots of coverage of the library (and its evolution) at
http://blog.abouttag.com/.


FISH COMMAND LINE ACCESS
========================

Fish can also be used for command-line access to FluidDB.
See 'USING THE COMMAND LINE', below.


DEPENDENCIES
============

If you're running python 2.6 or higher, Fish should just run.   With earlier
version of python, you need to get access to simplejson and httplib2.
You can get simplejson from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
and httplib2 from http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/.


CREDENTIALS
===========

For many operations, you also need an account on Fluidinfo,
and credentials (a username and password).   You can get these from
    http://fluidinfo.com/accounts/new
The library allows you to give it your credentials in various
different ways, but life is simplest if you stick them in
a 2-line file (preferably with restricted read access) in the format

username
password

On Unix-like operating systems (including Mac OS X), the default location
for this is ~/.fluidDBcredentials.

On windows, the location of the credentials file is specified
by the environment variable FDB_CREDENTIALS_FILE; if that is not
set, then Fish looks for c:\fish\credentials.txt.

You can also optionally add a line, after password, saying either

unix-style-paths true
or unix-style-paths false


TAG CONVENTIONS
===============

As from version 2.00, Fish uses absolute Fluidinfo-style paths all the time
(i.e. you always specify the namespace and don't use a leading slash).
You can explicitly mandate this also by adding the line

unix-style-paths false

in your credentials file (see above).

If you instead set 

unix-style-paths true

on the third line of the credentials file, Fish uses unix-style paths,
meaning that paths are assumed to be relative to the user's namespace
unless they are introduced with a leading slash.  Also, the about tag
(fluiddb/about) may be referred to as /about.  This affects input and
output.

If you want to overrride this behaviour for a given command,
you can use the -U flag to specify that the command will use
unix-style paths, or -F to indicate that it will use fluidinfo-style
paths.


TESTS
=====

The library includes a set of tests.   If you have valid credentials,
and everything is OK, these should run successfully if you just execute
the file fish.py.   For example, at the time of writing this README file
(version 2.03 of the Fish), I get this:

$ fish test
......................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 22 tests in 46.311s

OK


USING THE LIBRARY
=================

Four ways of exploring the library are:
  1. look at the tests (the ones in the class TestFluidDB)
  2. look at the blog (http://abouttag.blogspot.com)
  3. read the function documentation, which is...existent.
  4. look at and run example.py, which should print DADGAD and 10.


USING THE COMMAND LINE
======================

Commands can be run by giving arguments to Fish.
For a list of commands, use

	fish help

An example command is

python fish show -a DADGAD rating /fluiddb/about

Obviously, if you want to use Fish as a command from the shell, it will
probably be convenient to use an alias or create a trivial shell script
to run it.   I use bash, with the alias

alias fish='~/python/fluiddb/fish'

which allows me to type

fish show -a DADGAD rating /fluiddb/about

You can also put a link to Fish into some directory (like ~/bin) on your
``PATH``.


DELICIOUS
=========

Also distributed with Fish itself is code for accessing delicious.com
(http://del.icio.us/, as was), and for migrating bookmarks and other
data to Fluidinfo.   This also includes functionality for creating web
homepages from delicious based on a home tag.   See the README-DELICIOUS
file for details on this functionality.
